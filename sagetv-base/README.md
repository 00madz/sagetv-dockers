# SageTV Media Server Docker

SageTV is a cross platform PVR (personal video recorder).

The purpose of this docker is to provide an easy setup of SageTV which may include things like lirc, gentuner, comskip, etc, and make it easily accessible and upgradeable in a single container.

Please note, that after you setup this container, you'll need to use the SageTV Placeshifter (Linux/Windows/Mac), or SageTV Hardware (HD100,200,300), or the SageTV Android MiniClient to complete the setup process.  SageTV does not have a web ui for configuration.

# Configuration Options
See the [Options](OPTIONS.md) for information about the configuration options available

# Change Log
